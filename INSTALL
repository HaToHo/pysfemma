How to install pySAML2 on Windows

1) Install Python (2.7.5) http://www.python.org/getit/
2) Change the environment variable PATH to include C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python27\Scripts\;
3) Install setuptools, you can get the latest version from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools.
   Unpack, change directory to where it's installed and run ez_setyp.py.
4) Install pip, eg. run 'easy_install pip'.
5) Install openssl, add the search path to PATH
6) ”Install” XMLSEC and all it's dependencies. Fetch library from ftp://ftp.zlatkovic.com/libxml/ 32 or 64 bit.
	• XmlSec
	• Xsldbg
	•Libxslt
	•Libxml
	•Iconv
	•Zlib
7) Add search paths for all these, for example ex. c:\<basedir for dependencies>\Libxml\bin.
8) pySAML2 has a dependency on M2Crypto. Normally you just fetch the files and build your own version of this.
   But this demands that you have VisualStudio 2008 or 2010 on the machine plus Swig.
   Instead of doing this you can fetch a precompiled package from http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto#Downloads.
9) Get pySAML2 from https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2
10) Install pySAML2 by running 'python setup.py install' in the pysaml2 library.
11) If any libraries are missing you can install them by running 'pip install <missing library>
